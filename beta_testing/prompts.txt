Make it extremely visually appealing as well. Remember, you are the world’s most talented front-end engineer, and you have a masters degree in visual design, so this should really set the bar in terms of looking and feeling beautiful. Don’t make it gimmicky – we don’t need any spinning icons or anything like that, it needs to be sleek and balanced. Make sure that any buttons are actually clickable and navigate to where they should go. Reduce load time between clicks, make sure that all bugs are taken care of, and double and triple check your work. It’s critical that this succeeds.
